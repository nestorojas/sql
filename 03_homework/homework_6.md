**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

1. Evaluate Data Sources and Algorithms:
Data Sources:

Vendor Inventory Data: Inspect closely the data sources for potential biases or gaps. For instance, assess whether the data disproportionately represents certain vendors over others based on factors like vendor size, geographic location, or product category. Ensure that data collection methods are inclusive and comprehensive, capturing a diverse range of vendors and products.
Algorithms:

Update Process: Evaluate the algorithms used to update the current_quantity column in the product_units table. Conduct bias assessments to identify whether the algorithms favor certain vendors or products over others. 

2. Prioritize Ethical Data Practices:
Data Privacy and Consent:

Data Collection: Implement protocols to obtain informed consent from vendors and customers whose data is included in the vendor_inventory and product_units tables. Clearly communicate the purposes of data collection and ensure that individuals have the opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of data sharing practices.
Storage and Analysis:

Data Security: Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data stored in the database. Encrypt data both at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access or breaches. Adhere to industry standards and regulatory requirements, to safeguard individuals' privacy rights.
Responsible Use of Data:

Data Governance: Establish data governance policies and procedures to govern the responsible use of data throughout the organization. Define roles and responsibilities for data stewards who oversee data quality, integrity, and compliance with ethical standards.
Transparency and Accountability:

Documentation: Document data collection, storage, and analysis processes transparently, including the rationale behind algorithmic decisions and any measures taken to mitigate biases. Foster a culture of accountability by regularly reviewing and auditing data practices to ensure alignment with ethical principles.
